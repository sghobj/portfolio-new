                I’m a software developer with a mechatronics background, passionate about building smart and efficient solutions.
                My work spans full-stack development, cloud computing, and web technologies, with a strong focus on creating seamless user experiences.
                Curious by nature, I enjoy learning about AI, embedded systems, and automation, always exploring new ways to bridge hardware and software.
                Beyond coding, I’m an artist, an athlete, and a traveler—constantly seeking inspiration in both technology and the world around me.
